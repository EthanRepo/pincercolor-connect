# PincerColor Extension
Project for Engineering: Design and Modeling for school. This needs an external piece (that we created)
The project is based on a toy you need to make for a child, the example is Daniel, a 3 year-old with a developing pincer grasp.
This toy will help him develop a strong grasp.
The Toy is a square that is 10 inches by 10 inches with 4 colors. There is a peg that you can insert into a slot in each color.
This is where the website comes in. The website chooses a random color to insert the peg into. When you choose another color, the kid, Daniel, has to use his pincer grasp to pull it back out.
What the Website Does:
* Connects the PincerColor (Toy) *Just Visual, doesn't actually connect via USB*
* Runs two Scripts; Easy and Hard (Easy = 1 color, Hard = 2 colors)
* Makes the PincerColor a real toy!
