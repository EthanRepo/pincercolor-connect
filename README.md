# PincerColor Connectâ„¢
Project for Engineering: Design and Modeling for school. This needs an external piece (that we created)
The project is based on a toy you need to make for a child, the example is Daniel, a 3 year-old with a developing pincer grasp.

This toy will help him develop a strong grasp.

The Toy is a square that is 10 inches by 10 inches with 4 colors. There is a peg that you can insert into a slot in each color.
This is where the website comes in. The website chooses a random color to insert the peg into. When you choose another color, the kid, Daniel, has to use his pincer grasp to pull it back out.

What the Website Does:
* Connects the PincerColor (Toy) *Just Visual, doesn't actually connect via USB*
* Runs two Scripts; Easy and Hard (Easy = 1 color, Hard = 2 colors)
* Makes the PincerColor a real toy!

TinkerCad image for anyone wondering what this is:

When on connect: click "c" on your keyboard to connect the pincercolor. If you press nothing it will say failed to connect.

# Why I made this Website

I made this webiste, not only to add to the simple project of our toy for engineering, but to improve my programming skills. I recently started programming, and I only knew Intermediate HTML and Beginner/Intermediate CSS, as well has no JavaScript. With the creation of this website I have started to learn JavaScript, learnt a new form of HTML, and I am finally decent at CSS.
